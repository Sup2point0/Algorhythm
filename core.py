  `screen.state` and `screen.fade` control what displays on screen. Sprites only render if the current `screen.state` is in their configured list of screen states.
  
  When `screen.switch` is set, `screen.state` is updated to that at the start of the next frame (to avoid conflicting screen state processing within the same frame). While fading out, `screen.fade` becomes `'out'`, freezing sprites from updating. Once the screen entirely blacks out, `screen.fade` briefly becomes `'dark'`. In this time window (where the player cannot see anything), sprites update again, changing the rendered screen.
