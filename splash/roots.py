'''
Reusable sprite functionality

Often, sprites will take a `root` argument when instantiated. This is a `Callable` (a function) that will be called to provide the sprite with functionality. For instance, a button would call its `root` when clicked.

This file centralises the functionality of various sprites, as well as providing functions to dynamically generate other functions. This is useful for sprites that have similar but slightly differing functionality â€“ such as a button switching to a particular screen.
