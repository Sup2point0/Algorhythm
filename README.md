## Credits

This was entirely a solo project, with the intention of challenging myself to finally create a proper, finished game!

### Game
- Much inspired by [*Phigros*](https://phigros.fandom.com/wiki/Phigros_Wiki), as well as various other rhythm games ([*Ryceam*](https://ryceam.fandom.com/wiki/Ryceam_Wiki), [*rote<sup>2</sup>*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1735670/roteroteSquare)).

### Code
- Coded entirely by yours truly, from scratch.
- Made in [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org) with [Pygame 2.5](https://www.pygame.org).

### Assets
- Cover art for some tracks were generated using [DALL-E 3](https://openai.com/dall-e-3).

### Fonts
- [Geologica](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Geologica) (available on Google Fonts)

### Sounds
- Only the tracks in the *Xenos* series are by other artists.
- All other soundtracks and sound effects were created by yours truly, in [GarageBand](https://www.apple.com/ios/garageband) (iPadOS).

## Charts

In the unlikely scenario that you would like to create a chart... it is not easy, but would be hugely appreciated. See [charting](docs/charting.md).
