Lose yourself in rhythmic delight as you jackhammer the keyboard to the beat!

Inspired by the likes of *Phigros* and *Ryceam*, *Algorhythm* takes a spin on traditional lane-based keyboard rhythm games.

Why have the lanes and keys be static? In *Algorhythm*, shifting lanes and changing keys unlock an intense and dynamic new experience.

### Features
 - 6 unique note kinds to discover
 - ? songs, including ? original tracks
 - Up to 4 charts with different difficulty levels for each track
 - ? meticulously hand-crafted charts (with more being added!)
